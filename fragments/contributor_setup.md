1. Fork the [{{repo_name}} repository]({{repo_url}}) on GitHub.

2. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).<br/>
Poetry is an amazing tool for managing dependencies & virtual environments, building packages and publishing them.

        pipx install poetry

   <sub>If you encounter any problems, refer to [the official documentation (https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for the most up-to-date installation instructions.</sub>

   Be sure to have Python {{python_version}} installedâ€”if you use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#readme), simply run:

        pyenv install {{python_version}}

3. Clone your fork locally and install dependencies.

   > [!Note]
   > If you use Windows, it is highly recommended to complete the installation in the way presented below through [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

        git clone https://github.com/your-username/{{repo_name}} path/to/{{repo_name}}
        cd path/to/{{repo_name}}
        poetry env use $(cat .python-version)
        poetry install
        poetry shell
        pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
